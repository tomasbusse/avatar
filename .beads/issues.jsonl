{"id":"beethoven-78q","title":"Feature: Audio-Only Lesson Mode - Add option to run lessons with audio only (no avatar video)","description":"## Summary\n\nAdd an explicit 'audioOnly' mode for lessons that uses TTS audio with a static avatar image instead of rendering the Beyond Presence video avatar. This mode can be selected when creating lessons to:\n- Save on Beyond Presence API costs\n- Work when avatar video quota is exceeded\n- Provide a lighter-weight lesson experience\n\n## Background\n\nThe Python agent already has audio-only fallback code (lines 1284-1447 in apps/agent/main.py) that activates when Beyond Presence fails (quota exceeded, auth error, rate limited, etc.). This feature request is to make audio-only mode an intentional, configurable option rather than just a fallback.\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Schema Updates (convex/schema.ts)\n- Add `audioOnly: v.optional(v.boolean())` to `structuredLessons` table\n- Add `audioOnly: v.optional(v.boolean())` to `sessions` table\n\n### 2. Session Creation Updates (convex/sessions.ts)\n- Modify `createFromStructuredLesson` to pass through `audioOnly` flag to session\n- Ensure `createSession` accepts optional `audioOnly` parameter\n\n### 3. Admin UI Updates (app/(dashboard)/admin/lessons/page.tsx or related)\n- Add toggle/checkbox for \"Audio Only Mode\" when creating a structured lesson\n- Include tooltip explaining: \"Uses TTS audio with static avatar image instead of video avatar. Saves API costs.\"\n\n### 4. Frontend Lesson Room Updates\n- Modify lesson room component to check session.audioOnly flag\n- When audioOnly=true:\n  - Display static avatar image (from avatar.appearance.avatarImage) instead of video track\n  - Hide/disable avatar video track subscription\n  - TTS audio still plays normally\n- Reference existing components:\n  - components/lesson/lesson-room.tsx\n  - components/lesson/teaching-room.tsx\n\n### 5. Python Agent Updates (apps/agent/main.py)\n- Read `audioOnly` flag from session data (fetched via Convex client)\n- When audioOnly=true:\n  - Skip Beyond Presence avatar initialization entirely (don't even attempt)\n  - Set `audio_only_mode = True` at the start\n  - Use existing audio-only code path\n- This avoids wasting API calls and reduces startup latency\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Admin can toggle \"Audio Only\" when creating a structured lesson\n- [ ] When audioOnly lesson is started, frontend shows static avatar image\n- [ ] TTS audio plays normally in audioOnly mode\n- [ ] Python agent skips avatar video initialization for audioOnly sessions\n- [ ] Existing fallback behavior still works when avatar fails unexpectedly\n- [ ] No regression to normal avatar video lessons\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- Avatar static images are stored in `avatar.appearance.avatarImage` field\n- The existing `audio_only_mode` variable in main.py should be set based on session config\n- Session data is already fetched via ConvexClient in the agent\n- Consider adding visual indicator in lesson UI showing \"Audio Only Mode\" to student\n\n## Related Files\n\n- `/Users/tomas/apps/beethoven/convex/schema.ts` - Database schema\n- `/Users/tomas/apps/beethoven/convex/sessions.ts` - Session mutations/queries\n- `/Users/tomas/apps/beethoven/apps/agent/main.py` - Python agent (lines 1284-1447 for existing fallback)\n- `/Users/tomas/apps/beethoven/components/lesson/lesson-room.tsx` - Frontend lesson UI\n- `/Users/tomas/apps/beethoven/components/lesson/teaching-room.tsx` - Teaching room component\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Automatic switching between video and audio-only based on quota\n- Per-session toggle (only per-lesson configuration for now)\n- Audio-only for quick practice or free conversation (only structured lessons)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-04T17:43:48.668012+01:00","created_by":"tomas","updated_at":"2026-01-04T17:43:48.668012+01:00","labels":["area:agent","area:frontend","area:lessons","cost-saving","type:enhancement"]}

{"id":"beethoven-xcs","title":"Shareable Game Links for Client Sessions","description":"## Summary\n\nAdd the ability to generate unique shareable links for games so teachers can invite students/clients to play games together in real-time. This enables collaborative/multiplayer gameplay between teacher and student over the web.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Beethoven platform already has a robust game system (components/games/) with multiple game types:\n- SentenceBuilder, FillInBlank, WordOrdering, MatchingPairs\n- WordScramble, MultipleChoice, Flashcards, Hangman, Crossword\n\nGames are stored in the `wordGames` table with individual play sessions tracked in `gameSessions`. However, the current implementation only supports single-player mode. This feature extends the system to support real-time multiplayer sessions via shareable links.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### 1. Unique Token Generation\n- Generate cryptographically secure tokens for game sessions\n- Tokens should be URL-safe and reasonably short (e.g., 12-16 chars)\n- Tokens must be indexed in database for fast lookup\n\n### 2. Shareable URL Structure\n- Create routes like `/games/play/[token]` for public game access\n- URLs should work without authentication for invited clients\n- Consider optional password protection for additional security\n\n### 3. Real-time Multiplayer State\n- Extend `gameSessions` table with multiplayer fields:\n  - `shareToken`: unique token for the link\n  - `hostUserId`: teacher/creator ID\n  - `participants`: array of connected participants\n  - `isMultiplayer`: boolean flag\n  - `sharedState`: synchronized game state object\n- Use Convex subscriptions for real-time state sync\n\n### 4. Game State Synchronization\n- Sync current question/card/item index across participants\n- Sync answers and progress\n- Handle turn-based vs concurrent gameplay modes\n- Implement conflict resolution for simultaneous actions\n\n### 5. UI for Link Generation\n- Add \"Share Game\" button in admin/games interface\n- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for the shareable URL\n- Show QR code option for easy mobile joining\n- Display list of active shared sessions\n\n### 6. Join Flow for Clients\n- Landing page at `/games/play/[token]`\n- Prompt for name/nickname if not authenticated\n- Display game waiting room until host starts\n- Show participant list in real-time\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Database Changes (convex/schema.ts)\n- Add `shareToken` field to `gameSessions` with unique index\n- Add `multiplayerSessions` table or extend `gameSessions` with:\n  - `hostUserId`, `participants`, `gameSettings`\n  - `status`: \"waiting\", \"active\", \"completed\"\n\n### New Convex Functions (convex/wordGames.ts)\n- `createShareableSession`: Generate token, create session\n- `joinSharedSession`: Add participant to session\n- `getSessionByToken`: Lookup by share token\n- `updateSharedGameState`: Sync state across participants\n- `leaveSession`, `endSharedSession`\n\n### Frontend Routes\n- `app/(public)/games/play/[token]/page.tsx` - Public join page\n- `app/(dashboard)/admin/games/[gameId]/share/page.tsx` - Share management\n\n### Components\n- `ShareGameDialog` - Modal with link generation UI\n- `GameWaitingRoom` - Pre-game lobby\n- `MultiplayerGameWrapper` - Real-time sync wrapper\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Teacher can click \"Share\" on any published game\n- [ ] Unique shareable URL is generated and copyable\n- [ ] Client can open link and join without creating account\n- [ ] Teacher sees client join in real-time (participant list)\n- [ ] Game state syncs in real-time between all participants\n- [ ] Game works across all supported game types\n- [ ] Host can end/close the shared session\n- [ ] Tokens expire or can be manually revoked\n- [ ] Session state persists if client briefly disconnects\n- [ ] Works on mobile browsers\n\n## Out of Scope (for initial version)\n\n- Voice/video chat integration (use LiveKit separately)\n- Score leaderboards between multiple students\n- Game tournaments/competitions\n- Replay/recording functionality\n- Anonymous/guest host creation\n\n## Related Files\n\n- `/Users/tomas/apps/beethoven/convex/wordGames.ts` - Game queries/mutations\n- `/Users/tomas/apps/beethoven/convex/schema.ts` - Database schema (lines 1127-1300)\n- `/Users/tomas/apps/beethoven/components/games/` - All game components\n- `/Users/tomas/apps/beethoven/app/(dashboard)/admin/games/` - Admin game pages\n\n## Estimated Effort\n\nMedium complexity - 2-3 days\n- Schema changes: 2-3 hours\n- Convex functions: 4-6 hours\n- Frontend routes/components: 8-12 hours\n- Testing multiplayer sync: 4-6 hours","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-04T17:47:03.769565+01:00","created_by":"tomas","updated_at":"2026-01-04T17:47:03.769565+01:00","labels":["area:convex","area:frontend","area:games","multiplayer","type:feature"]}
