Also add optional categoryId field to the existing blogPosts table.
- [✓] 2026-01-21 17:33 - Create convex/blogCategories.ts with queries and mutations: list (returns all categories sorted by order), getBySlug (returns single category), create, update, delete. Export them properly.
- [✓] 2026-01-21 17:37 - Create app/[locale]/blog/category/[slug]/page.tsx that fetches the category by slug and displays its posts. Include generateMetadata for SEO with title and description from category. Add Breadcrumbs showing Home > Blog > Category Name. Use the existing BlogCard component for the post grid.
- [✓] 2026-01-21 17:41 - Update app/[locale]/blog/page.tsx to add category filter tabs. Fetch all categories and display as horizontal tabs above the blog grid. Include an "All" tab. Style active tab with bg-sls-teal text-white, inactive with bg-sls-beige/50. Filter posts when tab is clicked.
